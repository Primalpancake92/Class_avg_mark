This is a set of files that are the source of the python project "class average mark". The point of this personal project is to make an open source script that is able to provide a set of summary data that calculates statistical data of a class's assessment task performance. I am unsure of the extent I will take this program to, but for now it is a personal side project to increase my portfolio in the software engineering/development scene. If this project is finalised, I will be able to make this open source and help teachers and TAs who are assigned to doing these types of duties.

The core skeleton of the program has been made. However there are some methods that have yet to be made, such as the standard deviation, median, IQR, and such. The general objective has also been established. The goal of this program is to provide some people who teach, or manage a class, be able to quickly grab summary data from the class. This makes things quicker for people who are teaching to calculating some basic stuff.

Completed the general input system of the script. Have also completed a separate file that contains the parser for the input of the student's first name, last name, and their mark for the respective task that the person is looking at.

The input parsing function was implemented into another function called "student data", where inputs that have been entered in would be passed through that function. It works for most cases, however formal testing have yet to be conducted.

I have only started logging progress on Git as of today. So bear with me.

Wrote the early iterations of the student, classroom, and teacher classes. 

Realised that the previous iterations of my program is highly lacking in most areas and have been able to clean things up and make it more structurally sound with the proper use of 
Object Oriented programming principles.

Right now the basic functions of the program operate as expected and a large majority of the program has been written. Everything is almost complete and I hope by the end of the year, this project's initial phase will be complete. 

Once this is completed, the next phase is using a front end langauge to program the GUI and given an open source API, the possiblity of deploying this app is highly likely by the end of the next year.
